# financialDataManagement

My first Java project. It aims at saving and vizualizing one's financial data.

# How to run it

As it was my first project in Java, I didn't have much knowledge about how to manage data files used in the code. Actually, all the informations are saved in .db files which have the following path: "C:\dev\moneyManager".

To make the code runnable, one thus needs to create this path or change the path name inside the code (Profile.java, line 32).
